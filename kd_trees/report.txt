1. Hours to complete the project: 36 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Brute-force Implementation): To solve this problem, I used the
   pdf and checklist to act as guidance and reference. The implementation was
   mostly straightforward for the most part. I went on the textbook authors'
   website to check the API of RedBlackBST and implemented accordingly. 
   The part that gave the most problem was the implemenation of nearest and
   the iterable nearest. I eventually figured I could just implement the
   iterable nearest and call it with p and 1 as arguments in nearest and 
   return the point in the iterable.

   Problem 2 (2d-tree Implementation): Once again, I used the pdf and checklist
   as guidance in implementing this problem. The first several methods were a
   bit more clear, but the other methods took a lot more thinking. I had to
   think about what arguments to pass. For example, I had to build a rectangle
   object of dimensions consisiting of negative and positive infinity. I also
   had to keep in mind the API's of all the structures, recursion, and how
   the search and insert worked in this implementation. I also ran into some
   null pointer exceptions because I forgot to place a recursive call to put.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   All in all, this project took a lot of thinking. I feel very rewarded for
   being able to complete it. I look forward to what other content comes in the
   future.
