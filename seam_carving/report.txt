1. Hours to complete the project: 18 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Energy Calculation): In solving this problem, I used the pdf and
   checklist as reference. Overall, I had to think a bit about the concept
   and how to actually get the energy calculated, but once I understood it, I
   was able to put it into code.

   Problem 2 (Seam Identification): Once again, I used the pdf and the
   checklist as references to help me. After looking at the checklist, I
   implemented this part of the project with a little bit of error and some
   time thinking. I eventully figured out the problems, including out of bounds
   errors.

   Problem 3 (Seam Removal): I used the pdf and the checklist as guiding
   references once again. I personally thought that this part of the
   project was a more straightforward, but I did run into some silly syntax
   errors along the way.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate,
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Overall, I thought this project wasn't too difficult while still allowing
   me to apply what I've learned in class.
