1. Hours to complete the project: 24 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (WordNet Data Type): In solving this problem, I used the pdf and
   checklist for reference. When implementing this API, some of the methods
   were pretty straightforward while others like the helper methods took a
   little more thinking. I also ran into some issues with
   ShortestCommonAncestor. I had to implement that file first in order for
   this one to work, and when I ran this file, I had to go into
   ShortestCommonAncestor to fix the issue.

   Problem 2 (ShortestCommonAncestor Data Type): Once again, I used the pdf
   and checklist for reference. In implementing this file, while the methods
   themselves took some thinking, I ran into a NullPointerException issue
   in my length that took in two iterables as parameters. I eventually figured
   out that my issue lied in the helper method triad().

   Problem 3 (Outcast Data Type): As in the previous two files, I used the pdf
   and checklist as reference. Implementing this file didn't take as much time
   as the other files did, and it was more straightforward for the most part.
   I just needed to know how everything tied in in order to produce the result.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate,
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   All in all, I felt like this was a rewarding project that reinforced my
   understanding of the concepts related to it. I look forward to what comes
   next.
