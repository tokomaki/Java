1. Hours to complete the project: 18 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Deque): To go about this problem, I used the pdf, the checklist,
   and the screencast. I also used the slide regarding basic data structures
   as reference. Problems I ran to included NullPointer exception errors and
   OutOfBounds exceptions. I eventually fixed these issues. I also needed to
   add some conditional statements when it came to AddFirst and AddLast.

   Problem 2 (Random Queue): Like the first problem, I used theh pdf,
   checklist, and screencast. I followed the checklist as closely as I could.
   I did end up getting some interesting errors, but eventually managed to
   find where I was going wrong. One important change was my usage of q.length
   vs N.

   Problem 3 (Subset): Subset was pretty straightforward for the most part.
   I just followed the checklist and implemented it appropriately. I didn't
   have any problems using StdIn.
   
3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   All in all, this project took some thinking. I got to better understand
   how to work with the structures - LinkedLists, Resizing Arrays, and
   Iterator. Completing this project felt rewarding.
